// Two Hajj consents of one fictional pilgrim (Martha, the subject of ExampleComposition).
// All organization names, identifiers and URLs are fictional examples: the origin
// country is Onesa (XXK) and the host is Taifafeki (XXR), the fictional countries
// shared with smart-trust-demo. Their consent codes CONSENT-XXK and CONSENT-XXR are
// fictional examples, modelled on the real CONSENT-MYS and CONSENT-KSA.
// The IPS.HAJJ.CONSENT code that says which consent this is goes in policyRule, with the
// CodeSystem version whose consent text the pilgrim was shown. There is no separate
// agreement: these two Consents are the policy.
